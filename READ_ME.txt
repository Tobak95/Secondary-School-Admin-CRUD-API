The secondary Crud Admin Crud API backend application connected to MongoDB that allows administrators to manage secondary school student records through full CRUD operations.


The Student Management API is a Node.js and Express.js backend application connected to MongoDB that allows administrators to manage secondary school student records through full CRUD operations. It features JWT-based authentication to ensure only logged-in users can access the system and role-based authorization so that only admins can create, update, or delete student data. The API enables creating new students, retrieving all students or a single student by ID, updating student information, and deleting a student record. Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt, and all requests requiring authorization must include a valid JWT in the Authorization header. For example, the delete operation accepts a DELETE request to /api/students/:studentId and, if the student exists, responds with a success message confirming the deletion; otherwise, it returns a not-found error. The server is configured via environment variables for the port, MongoDB URI, and JWT secret, and can be started after installing dependencies with npm install by running npm start.
